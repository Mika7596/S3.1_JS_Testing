## Introduction

This project is created to practice declaring functions that will be filtered by unit tests. So, there are no inputs asked nor outputs printed on DOM. I decided to call every function with a random argument (if needed) just to see if they all work and return the expected output befor testing them.

We have a data base which is a list of movies. Each movie forms and object where we can see its title, director, year of production, duration, genre and it's score.

In this exercise we consult the data base to get different information and then return the result in an array, as an object or a string variable, depending on the function.


## Requirements

You need to clone this repository or download the zip file of my code. In order to test the functions, you need to install Jest. Execute the next commands in your terminal-->
npm init --yes
npm install jest --dev-save

If you'd like to execute the functions and see the result, just comment the first line on my films.js file and open the index.html by your browser. Remember to have this line uncommented when testing the code; it helps us to import the list of movies from the DB.

You can test the code by using this command: npm test

## Contributions

I'd be grateful for any comments on my code. If there are any errors / bad practices, let me know by posting a new issue on this repo. Thank you!
